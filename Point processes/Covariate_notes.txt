## Getting started with 00_data/ 

- run 01_make_inPoly.R
            - This will create two objects, a vector and a matrix, in the derived data directory. Both contain the same information: whether each covariate grid cell is within the GGF polygon. 
- run 02_make_SPgfo.R. 
            - You have already got some variate of this, it creates the GGF polygon and saves it to the derived data directory. 

- run 03_make_rough_ST.R
            - Strain thickness = topographic gradient * compaction = tg * compressibility * pressure depletion
            - The original maps of strain thickness has additional smoothing applied to them, so I constructed my own. (Turns out there is also smoothing applied to topograd maps, but I didn't get told about that until much later.)

## making_covariate_arrays/make_covariate_arrays.R 

- Makes covariate data frames into arrays that allow easy plotting and saved them in data/derived/covariates coordinates. 
- Arrays are (x,y,year) with cell values equal to covariate values. Covariate obects are a list, the first element is that array and subsequent elements are "axis values" along each side of the array. 
- Makes covariate objects for: 
            - topographic gradient, 
            - compressibility, 
            - the poro-elastic constant H [roughly describes how much of the strain thickness is taken by the structure rather than the gas], 
            - the compaction map provided by Shell, 
            - pressure depletion (annual not cumulative), 
            - my own unsmoothed version of compaction,
            - the corresponding strain thickness 
            - the corresponding incremental coulomb stress. 

## S4_ics_exponential/S4_fitting.R 

Finally onto some stats! (Actually this code is disgusting. Sorry, past me was the worst.)

- missing dependency: spatstat and spatstat.core::blur is now spatstat.explore::blur in smooth_cov_mat

- Optimisation is slow because we are also optimising over smoothing scale. 

- Past line 92 is a mess and not actually used. (If you ever find yourself copying and pasting large chunks of code, maybe re-think if what you are doing is sensible or could be a function. I hope I am now slighly better at this.)

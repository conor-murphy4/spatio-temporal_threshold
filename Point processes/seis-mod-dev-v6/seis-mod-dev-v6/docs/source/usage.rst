Usage
=====

After install the package, two scripts are made available:

* ``seismod-sample``: Used for generating samples for the parameters of a given model,
  based on an observed catalogue and constrained to some training period.
* ``ologp-compare``: Used for comparing two models using synthetic catalogues to check for
  the possibility of biases given difference in maximum magnitude between training and
  evaluation catalogues.

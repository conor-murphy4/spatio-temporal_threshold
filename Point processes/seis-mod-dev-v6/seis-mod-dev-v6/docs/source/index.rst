Welcome to Seismological Model v6 documentation
===============================================

This package contains basic classes and scripts used to sample and run different seismological models. These
models are based on the specifications of the Seismological Model v6, which are used as inputs in the Groningen
PSHRA tool. The details of the specific seismological models implemented here are described in the
:ref:`references <references>` (with further references therein). Note that only the large gradient approximation is
currently implemented.
